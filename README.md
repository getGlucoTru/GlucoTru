Today, James markets GlucoTru to diabetics, pre-diabetics, and anyone concerned about their blood sugar levels, claiming his formula can support healthy blood sugar levels.

Here are some of the things that occur when you take two capsules of GlucoTru daily, according to Maximum Edge Nutrition:

**Chromium**, **manganese**, and other minerals in GlucoTru support your metabolism and stimulate insulin production. Each serving of GlucoTru contains a significant dose of manganese, for example, that turns your blood sugar into energy it can burn. Manganese is an important mineral also involved in healthy brain and nervous system function, while chromium can help your body burn fat faster.

B vitamins like **biotin**, meanwhile, help your body convert food into energy while boosting metabolism. Biotin and other B vitamins play a critical role in energy production throughout the body. The biotin in GlucoTru, according to the official website, can help metabolize carbs, fats, and proteins more effectively. Plus, biotin has the added benefit of supporting your nervous system, liver, eyes, hair, and skin, according to Maximum Edge Nutrition.

GlucoTru also contains unique herbal extracts and plant-based ingredients, including the extract of a leafy vine called **Gymnema sylvestre**. That vine has been used for centuries in traditional Indian medicine (Ayurvedic medicine). It also supports healthy blood sugar and curbs appetite, according to Maximum Edge Nutrition. Many diabetics struggle with appetite control and food cravings because of imbalanced blood sugar. The gymnema sylvestre in GlucoTru can tackle that problem from two angles.

Spices like **cinnamon** and **licorice**, meanwhile, do more than just add flavor to food; they also play a critical role in GlucoTru and how it works. Licorice is one of the world’s oldest herbal remedies, for example, and it was used in ancient China, Greece, and the Middle East. Today, research shows licorice can act as a weight loss aid by helping to control appetite, giving your body a blend of valuable flavonoids, and exhibiting other effects to help with weight loss. Cinnamon, meanwhile, can promote healthy blood pressure and digestion while exhibiting anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties.

Other ingredients in GlucoTru include **zinc** (to stimulate insulin production in the pancreas) and **juniper berries** (to provide you with vitamin C and other antioxidants to support the immune system and healthy inflammation).

Together, these ingredients can support healthy blood sugar, sleep, immune function, and more. Overall, GlucoTru contains 15+ herbs, plants, vitamins, and minerals to support various body functions linked to blood sugar and more.

**[GlucoTru](https://groups.google.com/g/get-glucotru/c/NW1xbBaU1iA) Supports Sleep to Balance Blood Sugar**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren’t getting enough sleep, then you’re making it hard for your body to balance blood sugar. Your body needs sleep to rejuvenate, produce hormones, and activate other body processes involved in blood sugar support.

That’s why James Walker and the Maximum Edge Nutrition team designed GlucoTru to support a good night’s sleep. Here’s how they explain the sleep inducing effects of the supplement at the official website:

_“…when you sleep, your body goes into repair mode. This is especially important when your body is under stress.”_

When your body faces stress, it needs to enter repair mode. Your body sends blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the source of your stress, for example, to rejuvenate your body overnight.

We encounter stressors every day. Some stressors are physical. Exercise stresses our body, and our body rebuilds our muscles to make us stronger. Other stressors are mental, and mental stressors can force your body to raise cortisol levels.

GlucoTru isn’t just designed to support an _average_ sleep; instead, the formula is designed to support a deep sleep. Deep sleep is particularly important for hormone balance and blood sugar:

_“During deep sleep your body is able to balance important hormones, such as cortisol, your ‘belly fat storing’ hormone.”_

When you don’t get enough deep sleep, your cortisol levels rise. Your body becomes increasingly stressed, and this problem gets worse over time. High cortisol levels lead to visceral fat and imbalanced hormones, making it increasingly difficult to balance blood sugar and lose weight.

The 15+ ingredients in GlucoTru can help you fall asleep, enter a deep sleep, and wake up feeling refreshed, giving your body the best possible chance of fighting back stressors.

**How [GlucoTru](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/1ae5fe0d-42d7-4831-93b9-57163e2dc369/page/Y0TND) Uses Beta Cells for Blood Sugar**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

James Walker also developed GlucoTru to target beta cells, which play a crucial role in blood sugar management and diabetes.

Beta cells are crucial for blood sugar because they’re the cells that produce and release insulin, the hormone that absorbs sugar in your blood and lowers blood sugar. Your pancreas is filled with beta cells that produce insulin.

When you consume a sugary meal, the beta cells in your pancreas respond by releasing stored insulin. Then, they continue to make more insulin until your blood sugar is balanced.

As Diabetes.co.uk explains, beta cells also secrete amylin and C-peptide, which are also linked to blood sugar. Amylin slows the rate of glucose entering the bloodstream, which can help with short-term management of blood sugar levels. C-peptide, for example, helps with artery repair and overall cardiovascular health.

**[GlucoTru](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glucotru-official-update) Ingredients**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Although Maximum Edge Nutrition does not disclose dosage information upfront, the company does disclose most of the active ingredients within the formula.

Here are all of the active ingredients in GlucoTru:

*   Gymnema sylvestre
*   Biotin
*   Chromium
*   Manganese
*   Cinnamon
*   Licorice
*   Zinc
*   Juniper berry

The supplement also contains other sleep enhancing herbs and plants and hormone balancing ingredients, including 15+ ingredients in total. We’ll break down the science behind each of the above ingredients in the next section.

**GlucoTru & Science: How the Ingredients Work**
------------------------------------------------

GlucoTru was formulated by a man named James Walker to support healthy blood sugar. Although James does not claim to be a doctor, nutritionist, or medical expert, he’s confident his formula uses science-backed ingredients to target blood sugar in various ways. We’ll review some of the science behind GlucoTru and the ingredients within the formula below.

First, James is confident there’s a connection between **sleep and blood sugar issues**. By getting enough sleep each night, you can purportedly support healthy blood sugar. One study found a connection between sleep duration and the risk of diabetes. If you don’t get enough sleep on a regular basis, then you have a higher risk of developing diabetes and other health problems. Similarly, another study linked sleep deprivation to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes. When you take a supplement to support a healthy sleep, you could indirectly support your body’s natural defense against diabetes and blood sugar control issues.

**Cinnamon** also appears to help with blood sugar, and many diabetics take cinnamon daily as a natural supplement. In one study, type 1 diabetics taking 1g to 6g of cinnamon per day experienced a significant drop in blood sugar and cholesterol compared to a placebo. In another study, researchers found cinnamon had similar effects when taken daily over a 40 day period, with participants having lower blood sugar at the end of 40 days than the start, compared to a placebo.

**Licorice** is another unique ingredient in GlucoTru. Although it’s best-known as a candy and flavor, licorice has been used in traditional medicine for centuries as a natural remedy. Recent studies have validated the use of licorice for various purposes. A 2012 review, for example, found licorice was linked to positive effects on digestion, cardiovascular health, blood sugar, inflammation, and lung health, among other effects.

Overall, GlucoTru contains a blend of science-backed ingredients to help you support healthy blood sugar and sleep in multiple ways. Although we know little about the dosage or ingredients within GlucoTru, the supplement could support healthy blood sugar when combined with a doctor-recommended treatment program.

One of the biggest issues about GlucoTru is the lack of information about dosages.
